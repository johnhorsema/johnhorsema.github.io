In the retrieval step, semantic similarity is the metric used to identify relevant blog content. This enabled the chatbot to retrieve accurate and up-to-date information to support its responses. We carefully engineered the prompts to encourage the chatbot to reference the blog content and reduce the risk of hallucination.
The generation step involved ChatGPT, which generated responses based on the retrieved information.</description></item><item><title>Photography Studio Booking System</title><link>https://johnhorsema.github.io/project/photography-studio-booking-system/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jan 2022 19:58:14 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://johnhorsema.github.io/project/photography-studio-booking-system/</guid><description>Intelligent Booking System # In response to the client&amp;rsquo;s objective of optimizing time utilization, a crucial feature was requested: the ability to schedule 15-minute bookings within 10-minute time slots, thereby maximizing the number of daily bookings.
To accomplish this, I have crafted a conditional check within the booking system. This check enables the booking of 10-minute slots when all 15-minute slots have been reserved. By implementing this mechanism, the the available time slots are utilized to their fullest potential, while customers are able to modify or cancel their bookings in their own accord.</description></item></channel></rss>
