However, blockchain technology remains strong and transformative across various industries.
The vulnerabilities and attacks in the crypto space are often due to the implementation and security measures surrounding cryptocurrencies and decentralized finance platforms, not the blockchain technology itself.
To avoid risks, users should be cautious of projects with red flags, conduct thorough research on a project&amp;rsquo;s true utility, and evaluate its potential impact and long-term viability before making investment decisions.</description></item><item><title>How To Move Wordpress To a Subdirectory</title><link>https://johnhorsema.github.io/blog/how-to-move-wordpress-to-a-subdirectory/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Sep 2017 09:19:42 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://johnhorsema.github.io/blog/how-to-move-wordpress-to-a-subdirectory/</guid><description> Change .htaccess in the subdirectory, i.e. example, where Wordpress now sits # BEGIN WordPress &amp;lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&amp;gt; RewriteEngine On RewriteBase /example RewriteRule ^index\.php$ - [L] RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d RewriteRule . /example/index.php [L] &amp;lt;/IfModule&amp;gt; # END WordPress Edit wp-config.php and add the following lines define('WP_HOME','https://domain.com/example'); define('WP_SITEURL','https://domain.com/example');</description></item><item><title>Why I Enjoy Joining Hackathons</title><link>https://johnhorsema.github.io/blog/why-i-enjoy-joining-hackathons/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Aug 2017 09:19:42 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://johnhorsema.github.io/blog/why-i-enjoy-joining-hackathons/</guid><description>On April 22, I joined hackUST 2017, a hackathon organized by HKUST Entrepreneurship Center. For those who are still wondering: A hackathon is an event where groups of designers, idea-generators, technology experts get together to solve a problem under 24 or 36 hours, backed by technology and business ideas.

To better illustrate this, let’s look at a sample table:
id string mjZThqXnp7 QB1934 odGf0DZuUR JU9910 jemvgDUw6T UJ991 xkVGZbpG05 DF987 MtaNYMMgkV FL9111 jqZCZI0Fdn AM9114 xRNLSPEdAY AM914 yMDC1QNNMc P1N9 YAmabwCWla JU990 Tsoc1lqG6I Q1934B If we are using JU991 as input, the expected output would be
id string odGf0DZuUR JU9910 jemvgDUw6T UJ991 YAmabwCWla JU990 When you look at the results closely, you will identify the changes needed to change the input string to match the derived strings:</description></item></channel></rss>
